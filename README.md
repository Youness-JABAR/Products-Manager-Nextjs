# Products Manager App with Next.js 13

This is a simple Products Manager application built using Next.js 13. It allows you to create and show products.

## Features

- **Next.js 13**: The project is built using the Next.js framework, which offers server-side rendering, static site generation, and dynamic routing. You can learn more about Next.js in the [official documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs).

- **App Router System**: The application uses Next.js' routing system. You can find more information about routing [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing).

- **Server Actions**: This project leverages the power of server-side rendering (SSR) to fetch data from an external API , enhancing the dynamic capabilities of the application.
